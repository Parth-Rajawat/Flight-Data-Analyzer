# Flight-Data-Analyzer

## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for flight analytics and delay prediction. Synthetic flight data is generated, wrangled with PySpark, transformed into multiple analytical views, and loaded into a MySQL database. A Streamlit dashboard visualizes key insights such as flight status trends and busiest airports, while an integrated Random Forest model (~70% accuracy) predicts flight delays. The entire workflow is orchestrated and scheduled daily using Apache Airflow.

The pipeline is scheduled and orchestrated by Apache Airflow (dashed arrows). Data flows (solid arrows) from Synthetic Data Generator â†’ PySpark Wrangling â†’ Transformations (status, traffic, delay) â†’ MySQL Database, which powers a Streamlit Dashboard + ML Predictor. The workflow runs automatically every day at midnight.

| **Analytical Transformations** | Status trends, busiest airports, delay statistics (visualized with Matplotlib/Plotly) |
| **Streamlit Dashboard**     | 5+ interactive visual reports powered by MySQL |
| **ML Delay Prediction**     | Random Forest Classifier via **PySpark MLlib (~70% accuracy)** |
| **Airflow DAG Orchestration** | Daily scheduling, sequential + parallel task execution |
